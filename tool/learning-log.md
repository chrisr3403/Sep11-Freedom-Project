* Hello My name is Christian Ramos and I am here to talk about my learning log and about my tool.
 I'am using [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/)  for my Game editor DX. In some cases I tried to use the code that I started out for a game.
 Codes such as `// start the game kaboom()` as a way to start out the game of course I needed more time and code to try this but essentally I wanted to make a game start.
 My Progress on this is more slower then expected I still need to adapt to this tool and learn more about it.
 My question I really do have is: How will this work in some cases as giving it some thought. What will it give the audience the benefit of the doubt how good this game is.
 At first I had a challenge when it came to kahoots code. I thought "oh its just a game start up." well here is where it got tricky.
 See I needed more code when it came to my start game or things to make it give a idea on how to do it better. The code did not work at first
 then I looked into Kahoot gave me a code to play as a character and fixed it. The code gave me a sprite like this for example "// load a default sprite
loadBean()" I want to try how to make a character move next.

* Hello My name is Christian Ramos and here is a part two of my learning on kaboom!
In [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) I tried looking for the code to make my character move.
My progress is learning how to make a character jump which I had to look for it in Kaboom to make it work.
I used the code ```// jump when player presses "space" key
onKeyPress("space", () => {
// .jump() is provided by the body() component
    player.jump()``` which provides the player to jump essentially.
I had difficulty trying to find this code and making it work when I realized I missed a part of the code so I manage to fix it.
The question: How does code like this to make a character jump or play a animation. What makes the code function?
My next part will be on making the character be able to color change to whatever you want.

* Hello My name is Christian Ramos making a report on my third learning log.
During my time using [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) I found codes that may lead to my cosmetic platformer project of 2025 and personal project for 2026
I have inspected this code ```// blue frogadd([ sprite("bean"),color(0, 0, 255)])```  This code makes the color of a AI/Sprite/Player Skin be customizable to any color you want.
Just Follow the code padlette to chose any color you want to see what suits your best interest in this game that will be made.
Now lets start with the challenges of this, my challenge to know how to use the color was very interesting I looked at the code for the ```color(0, 0, 255)```
and at first it looked like location numbers which I tried looking further to see if there was other methods actually I tried it out at first the code did not even
respond or work so I assumed it was until it was put in the wrong area. My progress on it seems very good as now I know how to make color on ai and player skins.
My questions I have is what will color bring to the games, what is the hot take on this custimizable platformer.
Well to answer that question sometime in the future I will try how to swap skins using a sprite skin swap.
