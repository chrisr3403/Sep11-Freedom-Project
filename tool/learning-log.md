* Hello My name is Christian Ramos and I am here to talk about my learning log and about my tool.
 I'am using [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/)  for my Game editor DX. In some cases I tried to use the code that I started out for a game.
 Codes such as ```// start the game kaboom()``` as a way to start out the game of course I needed more time and code to try this but essentally I wanted to make a game start.
My Progress on this is more slower then expected I still need to adapt to this tool and learn more about it.
My question I really do have is: How will this work in some cases as giving it some thought
