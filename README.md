# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Christian Ramos**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study kaboom.js in order to help me make the sonic game I wanted to create!

## Implications
##### PROS
* My First pro is knowing what I wanted to create a platformer based game for you to switch characters collect rings and go to each level!
* My second pro is I knew where to start in and use the codes I knew and required!
##### CONS
* My first con is how will I set up the code correctly?
* Second con how will I fix any code snippets issues syntax errors as multiple of them were appearing?
