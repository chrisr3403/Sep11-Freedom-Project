Hello and Welcome! My name is Christian Ramos part of the SEP11 course coding class at HSTAT. 
I am here to share my blog and content about my learning so far about the tool that I use.
I am using this tool [kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/#sprite),is a game devolping tool for like platformer type games. With this tool you can make games that can be pixelated or 
 customizable. My learning of it has grown so much about it I do many tests like making ai to go to a certain position on the game code using kaboom.
One of the many codes I know is animations for a sprite ```const bean = add([ sprite("bean", {// start with animation "idle" anim: "idle", }),])``` this code is used for things such as 
idle animations in fact I am best known for doing idle animations for other coding programs.
Learning how to make animations is easy throughout the years of my experence and Kaboom extended that experence for my own platformer
to create games. In time I have devolped skills to know how to use my tool, skills such as knowing how to make more ai/sprites and make them also customizable.
The skill was very good to learn because then I can use the skills I know when it comes to making more ai I can make levels in games to be harder each time you increase a level.
It is really fascinating to learn Kaboom it is a useful tool even for my own personal projects I would suggest it to any who want to create their own cosmetic or regular based platformer.
