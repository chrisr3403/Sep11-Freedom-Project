Hello and Welcome! My name is Christian Ramos part of the SEP11 course coding class at HSTAT. 
I am here to share my blog and content about my learning so far about the tool that I use.
I am using kaboom this tool is a game devolping tool for like platformer type games. With this tool you can make games that can be pixelated or customizable.
My learning of it has grown so much about it I do many tests like making ai to go to a certain position on the game code using [kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/#sprite).
One of the many codes I know is animations for a sprite ```const bean = add([
    sprite("bean", {
        // start with animation "idle"
        anim: "idle",
    }),
])``` this code is used for things such as idle animations in fact I am best known for doing idle animations for other coding programs.
