## What I learned So Far: 
Hello My name is Christian Ramos and I am here to talk about what I learned so far for using my tool during this month. 
I am using this tool [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com) is a game developing tool for like platformer type games. With this tool you can make games that can be pixelated or 
customizable. My learning of it has grown so much about it I do many tests like making AI to go to a certain position on the game code using kaboom.
One of the many codes I know is animations for a sprite 
```js
const bean = add([ sprite("bean", {// start with animation "idle" anim: "idle", }),])
```
This code is used for things such as idle animations in fact I am best known for doing idle animations for other coding programs.
So what I tinkered with this code so far: 
```js
const bean = add([ sprite("bean", {// start with animation "run" anim: "run", }),])
``` 
this code instead of it taking the idle it's doing the running animation, when running its triggered when the player or AI wants to do that animation.


You can choose what animations you want to use for your player and AI maybe a attack animation but so far it is limited to what animations you want to do.
Learning how to make animations is easy throughout the years of my experience and Kaboom extended that experience for my own platformer.
to create games. In time I have developed skills to know how to use my tool, skills such as knowing how to make more AI/sprites and make them also customizable.
The skill was very good to learn because then I can use the skills I know when it comes to making more AI I can make levels in games to be harder each time you increase a level.
It is really fascinating to learn Kaboom it is a useful tool even for my own personal projects. 
Another Skill I have learned is knowing how to make animations and this skill was something I have been wanted to learn and have because in the future AI or the player character needs 
to have animations like a battle animation or a run animation. Learning how to do animations is really important in future gaming purposes.
I would suggest it to any who want to create their own cosmetic or regular based platformer to have a real good experience on how to make games. 
My engineering design process, since I started learning how to do animations due to creating AI and player cosmetics I realized I need to make the AI move at points of interest.
So I looked through Kaboom and found the code add`([sprite("ghosty"),pos(x, y),])` this research lead me to find the position of the sprite 
So this code gave me a start on moving AI on certain POI (Points Of Interest) whenever starting the game or running it the Ai or sprite will spawn at different locations.
But since I need location numbers I would have to randomly pick random numbers to make the AI go to where I want it to move in the area. which helped me solve the issue. 
So I conducted a plan what I tinkered with this `([sprite("optimus"),pos(x 100, y 100),])` I made this prototype of the sprite to go through a random location so it can move. 
During the test I have done so far I got the picture on locations using the position which is very hard to do but it manage. It still needs room for improvement as the location must be 
accurate I may need something in the future for locations and AI movement. My result was at first nothing happened but realized the AI was off the map. I am still testing it but It 
needs to be assigned to a specific location number for the AI to move. You can tinker it in the example Kaboom [Kaboom Example](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add) this will take 
you to the example so you can tinker and see how it operates when changing a position to move a AI.
