Hello and Welcome! My name is Christian Ramos part of the SEP11 course coding class at HSTAT. 
I am here to share my blog and content about my learning so far about the tool that I use. 
I am using this tool [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com) is a game developing tool for like platformer type games. With this tool you can make games that can be pixelated or 
customizable. My learning of it has grown so much about it I do many tests like making AI to go to a certain position on the game code using kaboom.
One of the many codes I know is animations for a sprite ```const bean = add([ sprite("bean", {// start with animation "idle" anim: "idle", }),])``` 
This code is used for things such as idle animations in fact I am best known for doing idle animations for other coding programs.
So what I tinkered with this code so far: ```const bean = add([ sprite("bean", {// start with animation "run" anim: "run", }),])``` 
this code instead of it taking the idle it's doing the running animation, when running its triggered when the player or AI wants to do that animation.
You can choose what animations you want to use for your player and AI maybe a attack animation but so far it is limited to what animations you want to do.
Since I started learning how to do animations due to creating AI and player cosmetics I realized I need more
Learning how to make animations is easy throughout the years of my experience and Kaboom extended that experience for my own platformer
to create games. In time I have developed skills to know how to use my tool, skills such as knowing how to make more AI/sprites and make them also customizable.
The skill was very good to learn because then I can use the skills I know when it comes to making more AI I can make levels in games to be harder each time you increase a level.
It is really fascinating to learn Kaboom it is a useful tool even for my own personal projects. 
I would suggest it to any who want to create their own cosmetic or regular based platformer to have a real good experience on how to make games. 
My engineering design process is trying to make a AI go one place to another the issue I see is for one: The AI need to go to a specific location on where they must go. 
The thing I require is the location finder methods that is needed to look for a good location for like spawning or moving. 
So I looked through Kaboom and found the code add`([sprite("ghosty"),pos(x, y),])`.
So this code gave me a start on moving AI on certain POI (Points Of Interest) whenever starting the game or running it the Ai or sprite will spawn at different locations 
which helped me solve the issue. What I tinkered with this `([sprite("optimus"),pos(x 100, y 100),])` so far I am still testing it but It needs to be assigned to a specific location 
number  for the AI to spawn. You can tinker it in the example Kaboom [Kaboom Example](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add) this will take you to the example so you can tinker and see 
how it operates.
